# Project Overview  
This project was born out of my love for running and learning and applying new technologies as I explore the world of AI workflow and automation.  
The Running Route bot is a ![Telegram Bot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-Bot-blue?logo=telegram) that generates personalized running routes based on user inputs like distance and run type (e.g. easy, tempo, interval). It integrates real-time weather data and provides motivational messages and Google Maps links for navigation.

Built using Zapier![Zapier](https://img.shields.io/badge/built_with-Zapier-orange?logo=zapier), Telegram API, OpenWeatherMap API, and custom JavaScript, this project showcases automation, API integration, and user-friendly design.
* Attribution:  The custom JavaScript found in two nodes in the automation workflow were created by Claude.ai (Sonnet4)

# Key Features  
* Telegram integration - "Send Message" & "Get Message" Action
* Parses natural language requests (e.g., "5km easy run")
* Fetches real-time weather data via OpenWeatherMap API  
* Provides motivational message
* Generates circular running routes via OpenRouteService with Google Maps links
* Handles multiple run types (easy, tempo, interval, recovery)

üîÑ Complete Data Flow  
User Input: "6k easy run" or "tempo 10k"  
    ‚Üì  
Parse: {distance: 6, unit: "km", runType: "easy"}  
    ‚Üì  
Weather: {temp: 28.04, description: "broken clouds"}  
    ‚Üì  
QOTD: {zenquotes.io}  
    ‚Üì  
Route: {actualDistance: 6.2, routeUrl: "google.com/maps/..."}  
    ‚Üì  
Response: Formatted message with all details  
    ‚Üì  
User receives: Complete running route recommendation  

## ‚ö° Automation Triggers & Timing  

Trigger: Every new message to Telegram bot    
Processing Time: 10-15 seconds total  
API Calls: 2 external APIs (OpenWeatherMap + OpenRouteService)  
Fallback: If OpenRouteService fails, uses simple route generation  
Rate Limits:  
OpenWeatherMap: 60 calls/minute  
OpenRouteService: 2000 calls/day (free tier)  

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Configuration Points  
Telegram: create Telegram bot  
Location Settings: Update coordinates in route generation code  
API Keys: OpenWeatherMap and OpenRouteService keys required  
Run Type Logic: Customizable route preferences  

## Challenges & Solutions  
Challenge: Lack of knowledge in JavaScripting  
Solution: Effective prompting of Claude.ai and iteratively improving the output via many trials and errors.  

Challenge: Generating realistic running routes.  
Solution: Using OpenRouteService API and prompting Claude.ai iteratively to finalise the JavaScript to implemented a circular route algorithm.  

Challenge: Handling API rate limits.  
Solution: Optimized API calls and used Zapier‚Äôs free tier effectively.  

Challenge: The JavaScript code for parsing messages and generating routes can be tricky to debug  
Solution: Prompting Claude.ai iteratively with text and screenshots until the bug was found and a satisfactory output was achieved.

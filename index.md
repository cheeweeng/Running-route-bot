# Running Route bot

Project Overview  
The Zapier Running Route Bot is a Telegram bot that generates personalized running routes based on user inputs like distance and run type (e.g. easy, tempo, interval). It integrates real-time weather data and provides motivational messages and Google Maps links for navigation.

Built using Zapier, Telegram API, OpenWeatherMap API, and custom JavaScript, this project showcases automation, API integration, and user-friendly design.
* Attribution:  The custom JavaScript found in two nodes in the automation workflow were created by Claude.ai (Sonnet4)
